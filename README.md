## Lurning Challenges

1. Function Exercises:
    1. ~~Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with all strings converted to uppercase.~~
    2. ~~Implement a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second largest number in the list.~~
    3. ~~Create a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).~~
2. File Handling:
    1. ~~Write a script that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word in the file.~~
    2. ~~Implement a function that takes a directory path and a file extension, and returns a list of all files in the
       directory with that extension.~~
    3. ~~Create a script that reads a CSV file and converts it into a JSON file.~~
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
    1. ~~Define a Rectangle class with attributes for length and width, and methods to calculate the area and
       perimeter.~~
    2. ~~Create a BankAccount class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.~~
    3. ~~Implement an Employee class with attributes for name, ID, and salary, and methods to calculate the annual
       salary
       and apply a raise.~~
4. Decorators:
    1. ~~Write a decorator that measures the execution time of a function and prints it.~~
    2. ~~Implement a decorator that caches the result of a function for a given set of arguments to improve
       performance.~~
    3. ~~Create a decorator that logs the input and output of a function.~~
5. Generators and Iterators:
    1. ~~Modify the `sum_even_numbers` function to use a generator expression instead of a list comprehension.~~
    2. Implement a generator function that yields Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit.
    3. Create an iterator class that iterates over the lines of a file.
6. Networking:
    1. Write a script that retrieves the HTML content of a given URL using the requests library.
    2. Implement a simple client-server communication using sockets.
    3. Create a script that downloads files from a remote server using FTP.
